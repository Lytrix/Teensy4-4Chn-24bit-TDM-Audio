# Teensy Audio 4 channel in/out TDM 24 bit 192kHz

This repo is a modification of the [Teensy 4 Audio TDM Library](http://github.com/paulstoffregen/audio) for the 4 channel in/out AK4619VN codec and the Audiostream of the [Teensy Cores Library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/cores/tree/master/teensy4) to be able to handle 24bit audio 192kHz as input and pass it through to the output using the Audio patchcords.

Todo:
Modify other audio library parts to handle 24 bit audio.
